# NewsApp
Kotlin
This app was developed as part of Kotlin development. The app involes using JSON to fetch the data from the website. A news
API is used to retrive the data and display it to the user in form of recycler view. Each item in the recyler view displays
the title. Once an item is clicked, the webpage is opened and the user can read the news.
This app serves as a perfect model to keep yourself updated with the latest news.
